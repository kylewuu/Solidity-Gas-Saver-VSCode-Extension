Welcome! The Solidity Gas Saver is a VSCode extension that was developed to give you some options for refactoring your Solidity code with variable packing. There are many approaches to variable packing, and choosing the best algorithm depends on the context, as they all have their strengths and weaknesses. We have listed them all out and have conducted evaluations with them on various smart contracts. Read through our findings and then decide which one will be best for your situation!
